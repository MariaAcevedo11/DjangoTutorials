Welcome, professor, to Mar√≠a Acevedo's Django tutorials repository.

Each commit corresponds to a different tutorial, and all of them are named as Tutorial # Completed.

Please note:

In the root of the project, there is a picture called proof.jpg. It shows that Tutorial 4 was completed, including the Insomnia part.
